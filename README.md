# Yield Regression Project

This repository contains a project focused on regression analysis as part of the Yield regression module. The primary goal of this project is to analyze and predict outcomes using regression models, and to optimize model performance with respect to Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Project Overview

The project explores various regression techniques to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables in a dataset. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we aim to find the best performing model with minimal error.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madinaAbdujabborova/Yield_regression
cd Yield_regression
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset
The project uses a dataset suitable for regression analysis. Details on the dataset can be found in the data folder. To use your dataset, make sure to follow the preprocessing steps outlined in the code.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model development
src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training
models/: Saved models and related outputs
README.md: Project documentation (this file)

## Usage
Preprocess the dataset by running the scripts in src/data_preprocessing.py.
Train the model by running src/model_training.py.
Evaluate the model using src/model_evaluation.py.

## Model Performance
The goal of the model is to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Key metrics and results are presented in the final evaluation.
